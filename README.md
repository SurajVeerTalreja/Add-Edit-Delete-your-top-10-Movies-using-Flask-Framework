# Add-Edit-Delete-your-top-10-Movies-using-Flask-Framework

Using Flask Framework, a website is created which is super easy to use and do the following:
1) You can add/edit/delete your favourite movie
2) Give each movie a rating (out of 10) and website automatically arrange them in descending order. You can edit ratings at anytime too.
3) You can add a title of a movie and the program fetches all the movies under that title to select from
4) Once you click any movie, it asks you to give it a "rating" and "review" and once you do that, it adds a movie to your database in order.
5) It also made use of TMDB API to fetch "title", "year", "overview", and "poster" for movie you enter in a "add movie" dialougue box"
6) Finally, it also uses SQLite to hold the database so that you never lose any data when program is run again.

Enjoy Playing around
